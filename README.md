## Variational-gan

Combining variational and adversarial concepts for generating faces. The main idea is to use critic network to improve GAN's ability to reconstruct original pictures

Final Model is composed of:
- Encoder (E)
- Generator (G)
- Discriminator (D)
- Latent space discriminator (C)
- Critic-network (S)
